Title: Text and Numeric Data Preprocessing with Feature Extraction

Description:
This GitHub repository offers a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing both numerical and textual data. It equips users with a diverse set of methods to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for further analysis or machine learning tasks. Additionally, the repository includes implementations of feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), enabling users to extract meaningful features from textual data for various applications.

Objectives:
1. Provide a comprehensive set of tools and techniques for preprocessing both numerical and textual data.
2. Streamline the data preprocessing pipeline to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
3. Offer functionalities to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for analysis or machine learning tasks.
4. Implement feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for textual data.
5. Empower users, including data scientists, researchers, and developers, to preprocess diverse datasets effectively.
6. Enable users to extract meaningful features from textual data to facilitate better analysis, modeling, and decision-making in machine learning and data-driven tasks.
